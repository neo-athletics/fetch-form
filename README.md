Fetch Rewards Form (Front End Take Home)

Project Description-

This project shows my skills in calling an API, retrieving results and displaying in the UI.
Also make a post request on successful submission of the form. The user will be greeted with a success message.

Technologies-

I decided to use the create react app bootstrap to get my application up and running. Once completed I hosted the project on Netlify for the recruiter and engineer to view and interact with it. I have also used the PropTypes package to check for the types of props being passed down to some of the components. I also used the Axios library to fetch the data. It is a preference of mine rather than using the built it Fetch API.

Challenges-

Some of the challenges I faced during this project was deciding what validation to add to the inputs and deciding what else the project needed to make it stand out.

Something I hope to have done is show a custom message based on what inputs the user didnâ€™t full fill. For now, I will just be showing the default errors the browser shows based on what inputs the user needs to satisfy. For the form to submit successfully.
